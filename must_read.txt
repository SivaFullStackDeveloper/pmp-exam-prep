Good question â€” and Iâ€™ll give it to you straight:

ðŸ‘‰ You do not need to read all of them cover to cover to pass the PMP exam.

Here's the ideal approach:

PMBOK 7: âœ… Must read. It's short compared to PMBOK 6. Focuses on principles and performance domains.

Agile Practice Guide: âœ… Important. Agile is a BIG part of today's PMP exam. Read it completely or at least understand the frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, Hybrid).

PMI Process Groups: A Practice Guide (2023): âœ… Helpful. It's new and aligns with exam changes. It connects PMBOK 6 "processes" to PMBOK 7 thinking.

Optional but HIGHLY recommended for easy understanding and practice:

Rita Mulcahy's 11th Edition: ðŸ“˜ Ritaâ€™s book simplifies hard concepts. Great for quick learning, memory tricks, and practice questions.

Joseph Phillips All-in-One Guide: ðŸ“— Good for practice questions and simplified explanations (if you like his style).
